## What is Banoffee Pie?

Banoffee pie is a traditional British dessert made with banana slices, whipped cream, and a caramel sauce. The name is a combination of "banana" and "toffee." The original recipe was created in 1971 by the owner and chef of Hungry Monk Restaurant in Sussex, England.

## Ingredients

### For the Crust:
- 1½ cups graham cracker crumbs
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger (optional)
- 6 tablespoons butter, melted

### For the Filling:
- 1 (13.4 ounce) can dulce de leche
- 3 bananas, sliced

### For the Topping:
- 1½ cups heavy cream
- 3 tablespoons powdered sugar

### Optional Garnishes:
- Chocolate shavings
- Espresso powder

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Crust**: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Mix graham cracker crumbs, white sugar, ginger (if using), and melted butter together in a medium bowl. Press mixture into an ungreased 9-inch fluted tart pan with removable bottom or 9-inch pie plate.

2. **Bake the Crust**: Bake crust in preheated oven until set, about 12-15 minutes. Cool crust on a wire rack for 15 minutes.

3. **Add the Filling**: Spread dulce de leche in the cooled crust; arrange banana slices evenly on top.

4. **Make the Whipped Cream**: Beat heavy cream and powdered sugar in a large bowl until stiff peaks form (about 3 minutes). Spread whipped cream over bananas.

5. **Chill and Serve**: Refrigerate pie for at least 2 hours or overnight. Before serving, sprinkle with chocolate shavings and/or espresso powder if desired.

## Tips from the Test Kitchen

- For a coffee-flavored twist, dissolve ½ teaspoon instant coffee in the cream before whipping
- Use canned dulce de leche for an easier alternative to making your own toffee

## Storage

- **Refrigerator**: Cover and store for up to 5 days
- **Freezer**: Not recommended, but can be frozen for up to 3 months if necessary
