# AgenticAI

An experimental workspace of agent projects and notebooks created while learning agentic workflows and language-model-assisted engineering. This repository contains compact examples, exploratory notebooks, and small prototype services for multi-agent and LM-assisted workflows.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`Basic Agents/`** — Introductory notebooks and simple agent examples
- **`Autogen/`** — Experiments with Autogen tooling and demos
- **`Langgraph/`** — Agents and structured-output notebooks using LangGraph
- **`CrewAI/`** — Small agent projects (coder, debate, engineering_team, stock_picker, etc.)
- **`MCP/`** — Lightweight servers, clients, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) tooling
- **`OpenAI SDK/`** — API experiments and helper notebooks
- **`Projects/`** — Personal projects and agent prototypes
## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- API keys for OpenAI and other services (as needed by specific projects)

### Installation

This workspace uses the `uv` package manager for dependency management:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if pyproject.toml is present)
uv sync
```
If you prefer another package manager (pip, Poetry, etc.), adapt the commands accordingly.

### Environment Setup

Many notebooks and projects require environment variables for API keys. Set these in `.env` file


## 📖 Usage Notes

- Individual subfolders may have their own requirements or README files ,check those for project-specific instructions.
- Some examples use different LLM providers and tools that may require additional API keys.
