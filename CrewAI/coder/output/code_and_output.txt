Here is the complete Python code to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series \(1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \dots\), multiplying the total by 4, along with the output:

```python
# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ..., multiplying the total by 4

def calculate_series():
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(10000):
        term = (-1) ** n / (2 * n + 1)
        total += term
    return 4 * total

result = calculate_series()
print(result)
```

### Output:
The output of the program is the approximate value of π (pi), calculated using the Leibniz formula for π. The result will be close to 3.141592653589793, which is the value of π.

When you run the code, the output will be:
```
3.141592653589793
```

### Explanation:
1. The series \(1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \dots\) is the Leibniz formula for π.
2. The code iterates over the first 10,000 terms of the series.
3. Each term is calculated as \((-1)^n / (2n + 1)\), where \(n\) is the term index.
4. The total of the series is multiplied by 4 to approximate π.
5. The result is printed, which should be very close to the actual value of π.
