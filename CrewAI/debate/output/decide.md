The side arguing **for** strict laws to regulate Large Language Models is more convincing. Its arguments are concrete, address high‑stakes risks (misinformation, privacy breaches, bias, accountability, national security, and job displacement), and propose clear mechanisms—transparency mandates, data consent requirements, bias audits, liability frameworks, and reskilling obligations—that directly mitigate these threats. While the opposing side raises valid concerns about innovation, adaptability, and global competition, it offers only abstract benefits of flexibility and self‑regulation without providing specific safeguards or demonstrating how those outcomes would be achieved. The pro‑regulation case therefore presents a more comprehensive, evidence‑based, and actionable rationale for why strict legislation is essential to harness LLMs responsibly while protecting society from their most severe potential harms.
